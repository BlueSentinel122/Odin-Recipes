# Odin-Recipes
Recipes Project

In this project, I will be creating a website that contains instructions for different dishes using HTML. 

Self Reflection (write after completion):

I familiarilized myself with several elements  for the project and learned how to use ordered/unordered lists fo recipes, strong and em elements to highlight and emphasize words, HTML comments to make suggestions and improvements; Another skill I demonstrated was being able to integrate relative and absolute links into the code using the anchor element. I also practiced using title, head and body elements for the webpage and its instructions, ingredients, and description. I also wrote down GIT commit messages in the imperative tone in my notebook everyday I worked on the project to keep track of my edits. Furthermore, I was able to gain additional practice with using the Linux terminal and using the GIT commit command to push my edits to Github.
