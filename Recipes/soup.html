     <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
     <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes</li> 
        <li>2 Tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>4 Tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 clves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 anchovy fillet</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (Optional) </li>
     </ul>
     <strong>Directions</strong>
      <li>Remove cores from tomatoes and cut in half crosswise.</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil and butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and anchovy and cook until garlic is sizzling in the hot fat, 45 seconds to 1 minute. 
          Carefully add the tomatoes with their juices, salt, and red pepper flakes. Toss with a spoon every few minutes until the tomatoes release their liquid and start to break down.</li>
      <li>Once the tomatoes have softened and start to collapse, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have fallen apart and the soup resembles a coarse tomato sauce, about 45 minutes. </li>
      <li>Remove soup from heat and pass through a mesh strainer into a bowl. Use the back of a ladle to push all the tomato mixture through. Discard the skins and seeds, which should be the only things left in the strainer.</li>
      <li> Transfer the strained tomato soup back into the saucepan and place back over medium-low heat. Continue cooking to thicken slightly, if desired, or simply bring back to a simmer and serve immediately with the cheese toasts.</li>
